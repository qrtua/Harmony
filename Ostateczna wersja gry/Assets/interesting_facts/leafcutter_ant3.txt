Leafcutter ants, a non-generic name, are any of 47 species of leaf-chewing ants belonging to the two genera
 Atta and Acromyrmex. These species of tropical, fungus-growing ants are all endemic to South and Central America,
 Mexico, and parts of the southern United States. Leafcutter ants can carry twenty times their body weight and 
cut and process fresh vegetation (leaves, flowers, and grasses) to serve as the nutritional substrate for their fungal
 cultivates.
