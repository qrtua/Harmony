Leafcutter ants, a non-generic name, are any of 47 species[1] of leaf-chewing ants belonging to the two genera
 Atta and Acromyrmex. These species of tropical, fungus-growing ants are all endemic to South and Central America,
 Mexico, and parts of the southern United States.[2] Leafcutter ants can carry twenty times their body weight[3] and 
cut and process fresh vegetation (leaves, flowers, and grasses) to serve as the nutritional substrate for their fungal
 cultivates.[4]
